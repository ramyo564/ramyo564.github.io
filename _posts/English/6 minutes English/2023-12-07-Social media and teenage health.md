Research in the US has found that **adolescents** who spend more than three hours a day on social media have double the risk of developing depression and anxiety. An **adolescent** is someone aged 10 to 19, between childhood and adulthood. With that in mind, it's no wonder parents are worried. To help with this, the US is currently in the process of **regulating** social media apps for teenagers. Some scientists think the UK should do the same.

- regulate : 규제하다, 단속하다.
