**Beth**
There’s a famous English saying, ‘a friend in need is a friend indeed’, and it’s true - everyone needs friends to share life’s ups and downs. Do you have many friends, Neil?

**Claudia Hammond**
Now, When **times are tough**, friends are often the people who **get** us **through**, who are there to listen, to reassure, maybe to advise us, if that's what we want. So why do we sometimes find it hard to make friends, or that the friends we used to have seemed to have somehow **drifted away**? Now, there is an idea that women are much better at maintaining their friendships, and that men are more likely to hang out with whoever is around rather than to nurture those relationships, and we were wondering whether this was really true or is that just a stereotype?
- reassure : 안심시키다.
- stereotype : n) 고정관념, v) 고정관념을 만들다, 정형화하다.

Max it's interesting that you kind of went public on this, if you like… Your book is even called **‘Billy No-Mates’** the very thing that, you know, a lot of us would dread being. It can't have been easy to decide to say this publicly…
- the very thing : 바로 그거, 안성맞춤
- dread : 몹시 두려워하다.

**Max Dickins**
No, it's a real **double-edged sword** being the face of a book called ‘Billy No-Mates’ I've gotta say… but I think.. so loneliness doesn't look like me. I'm in my early to mid-30s, I'm pretty **outgoing**, I'm quick to buy my round, it shouldn't look like me, but increasingly it does. So loneliness isn't just the elderly anymore it's younger people…
