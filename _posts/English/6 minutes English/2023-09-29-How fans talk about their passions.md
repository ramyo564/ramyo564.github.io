### In Talk

**Michael Bond**  
Kings ruled their kingdoms, fans certainly rule their fandoms. It taps into that ancient human impulse to belong to a group of **like-minded** people, and of course being a fan by yourself can be a challenging thing because fannish pursuits can look **quirky** and odd… even obsessive, and you get often **mocked** and, I mean, if you're Jane Austen fan and you want to dress up in a bonnet and gown of the Regency era it's difficult to do that by yourself in public, but once you join a fandom there's no problem.

- tap into : ~에 다가가다, ~와 친구가 되다., ~을 활용하다.
- impulse : n) (갑작스런) 충동, (반응을 불러일으키는) 충격, 자극
- fannish: 광적인
- pursuit: 추구, (에너지, 시간을 들이는) 취미

**Michael Bond**  
Academics who study fandoms, they love to use acronyms and abbreviations and they've got several phrases which they used to describe the behaviour of football fans… **BIRGing** so that means ‘Basking In Reflected Glory. When your team wins everyone wants **a bit of the action**, you take to the streets, dance around… and so the antithesis of that is **CORFing** which means ‘Cutting Off Reflected Failure’ and that is what people sometimes do when their team loses and they don't want to be associated with that loss, that sense of failure.

**antithesis**
a person or thing that is the direct opposite of someone or something else.
"love is the antithesis of selfishness"
- 둘 사이의 대조, 대립

**What is an abbreviation?**
An [_abbreviation_](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/abbreviation) is any shortened or contracted form of a word or phrase. Did you catch the word _any_ in there? That means _abbreviation_ is the blanket term for all these shortened words we’ve all been using on social media. _Rly_ is a great example … we just took out the vowels—who needs ‘em—and now it’s an abbreviation.
- 줄임말 -> ㅎㅇ, ㅂㄷㅂㄷ

**What is an acronym?**
For one, _acronyms_ are types of abbreviations.

Specifically, an _[acronym](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/acronym)_ is a specific type of abbreviation formed from the first letters of a multi-word term, name, or phrase, with those letters pronounced together as one term. _OPEC_—or the O(rganization of) P(etroleum) E(xporting) C(ountries)—is an acronym because we pronounce it as one word, **oh**-pek.
- 줄임말 -> 갑분싸, 별다줄


**Beth**  
Of course, true fans never CORF. In fact, some football fans take a kind of strange pessimistic pleasure when their team loses week after week.

**pessimistic**: 비관적인
