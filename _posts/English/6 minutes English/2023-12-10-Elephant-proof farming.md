## In Talk

**Beth**
Of course,**rubbing shoulders** with animals - spending time with them – is amazing. But imagine a hungry African elephant stumbling into your garden, and eating your prize vegetables! How would you stop it? **It sounds unlikely**, but that’s exactly the problem faced by farmers in Africa.
- It sounds unlikely : 그럴 것 같지 않다.


**Neil**  
Yes, as human populations increase while natural **habitats** decline, people and animals are increasingly being forced to compete for space. Wild animals can endanger humans when they break into their farms for food or water. And people might be forced to attack or even kill these animals to defend their homes.
- habitat : 서식지


**Beth**
This situation, known as **human-wildlife conflict**, is becoming more frequent. But in this programme we’ll be hearing about **ingenious** farmers in Kenya who are keeping their food safe from hungry wild animals. And, as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary.
- ingenious : 기발한


**Victor Ndombi**
So, they come from those private **ranches**, **national parks** and they come to this community. They are looking for where there is green **pasture**, so they come to this community where we have these nutritious foods… you know elephants love **maize**, beans, and that is the crop that farmers actually farm… so they come and eat those crops here, and also looking for water.
- ranch : 목장
- pasture : 초원
- maize : 옥수수

**Neil**
These crop raids have become more frequent because elephants are **desperate** to find water, and because the park lacks money to fix broken fences which keep wild animals out. Victor says the raids have become **a way of life**, an activity that has become a regular thing in people’s lives, rather than something that happens only occasionally.
- desperate : 될대로 되라는, 필사적인(극단적인)


**Beth**
That’s no problem if it’s a fox in your rubbish bin, but African elephants are as big as six cars on top of each other, and this **spells trouble** for the farmers. If something **spells trouble**, it suggest that there may be problems in the future.

**Beth**
Victor’s team install beehive fences to protect farmers’ crops. Real bees work best, but even a recording of bees **angrily** buzzing is enough to keep the elephants away. **Better yet**, the bees also **pollinate** plants, and even produce honey. It’s good news for the farmer, but I have to feel a little sorry for the elephants…
- angrily : 성난 (불같이)
- Better yet : 아니면
- pollinate : 수분하다.

**Beth**
If you **rub shoulders** with someone, you meet them and spend time together.
