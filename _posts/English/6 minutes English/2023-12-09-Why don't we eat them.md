## In Talk

**Phil**
Today we’re going to be talking about an interesting approach to the problem of **invasive** species. When animals or plants are introduced to new areas, they can be dangerous for existing wildlife.
- invasive : 급속히 퍼지는, 침투하는

**Beth**  
Tell me about it! Every time I plant something in my garden, squirrels dig it up. I’m getting really **fed up with** them.
- fed up with : 지긋지긋한, 신물난

**Phil**  
That’s right! One of the simplest ways to deal with invasive species is just to eat them. In this programme we’ll be hearing about initiatives in the UK and Belize that are trying to get people to improve things using their stomachs.
- initiative : 계획, 주도권


**Myra Anubi**  
Japanese knotweed is an extremely invasive plant that arrived in Europe from Japan over a century ago, this super weed doesn't just grow fast. It has root systems that are so strong and **resilient** that they can **withstand** molten lava **choke out** surrounding plants and cause a lot of damage to buildings.
- molten lava : 녹은 용암


**Phil**  
Yes, you could say that it can **withstand** a lot of damage – it can cope with it.
- cope with : ~에 대항하다, 대처하다.
