### In Talk

**Claire Marshall**  
They've got an incredibly complex **life cycle** and it's, scientists have been sort of working **feverishly** to try to close that life cycle, particularly in Mexico and Japan and obviously now Spain. They need live food – the **larvae**. And also octopuses are incredibly **solitary** and it just makes it really hard to manage to basically keep them in captivity at a commercial scale.
feverishly : 열광하여,과열된 / 열이나는
larvae : 유충, 앨벌레
solitary : 혼자 하는

**Dr Heather Browning**  
So, we wanted to look at whether they had specific kinds of nerve connections. Or if they have specific kinds of brains, and whether they were capable of performing certain kinds of **trade-off** behaviours or pain-related behaviours, learning behaviours that we thought would **correlate** with the probability of sentience. And what we found with octopuses in particular is they seemed to meet many of the criteria that we laid out.
correlate : 연관성이 있다/ 상관관계를 보여주다. 
sentience : 감각성, 지각력
criteria : **criterion** 의 복수 (기준)
lay out : 펼치다, 질책하다, 설계하다.

**Beth**  
The scientists found that octopuses do experience feelings because they show typical **characteristics** of sentient creatures, such as **trade-off** behaviour. **Trade-off** means giving up one thing in return for another, such as giving up shelter for food. So it looks like the debate about whether it’s OK to farm and eat octopuses will continue…
characteristics : 형질, 문자
