## Project Set Up
- We will extend our existing Employee project and add DB integration
- Add ***EmployeeService***, ***EmployeeRepository*** and ***Employee*** entity
	- Available in one of our previous projects
	- We created all of this code already from scratch ... so we'll just copy / paste it
- Allows us to focus on creating ***EmployeeController*** and Thymeleaf templates 

## Development Process
1. Get list of employess
2. Add a new employee
3. Update an existing employee
4. Delete an existing employee
